## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git](https://github.com/Jav4nsJuice/scheduling-api.git
    ```

2. **Open the Solution:**

    Open the project solution file (`Truextend.Scheduling.sln`) in Visual Studio Community. 

3. **Restore NuGet Packages:**

    Visual Studio should automatically restore the NuGet packages when you open the solution. However, if it doesn't, you can manually restore them:

    - Right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer.
    - Select "Restore NuGet Packages".

4. **Build the Project:**

    Build the project by selecting "Build > Build Solution" from the menu, or by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`. We used SQL Server 2019 dockerized for Mac. And created the DB structure with the running of migrations

5. **Run the Application:**

    Set the Presentation startup project and run the application by pressing `F5` or selecting "Debug > Start Debugging" from the menu.
